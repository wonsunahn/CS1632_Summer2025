 * Each bean is assigned a skill level according to a normal distribution with
 * average SKILL_AVERAGE and standard deviation SKILL_STDEV. The formula to
 * calculate the skill level is:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SKILL_AVERAGE = (double) (SLOT_COUNT-1) * 0.5
 * SKILL_STDEV = (double) Math.sqrt(SLOT_COUNT * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5))
 * SKILL_LEVEL = (int) Math.round(rand.nextGaussian() * SKILL_STDEV + SKILL_AVERAGE)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Make sure you bound SKILL_LEVEL to be between 0 and SLOT_COUNT-1, if the
 * randomly generated SKILL_LEVEL exceeds those bounds. If SKILL_LEVEL < 0, then
 * you can bound it to 0, and if SKILL_LEVEL > SLOT_COUNT-1, then you can bound
 * it to SLOT_COUNT-1.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A SKILL_LEVEL of SLOT_COUNT-1 means the bean always makes the "right" choices
 * (pun intended), always going right when a peg is encountered, resulting in it
 * falling into slot number SLOT_COUNT-1. A SKILL_LEVEL of 0 means that the bean
 * will always go left, resulting it falling into slot 0. For the in-between
 * SKILL_LEVELs, the bean will initially go right and then left. For example,
 * for a bean with SKILL_LEVEL SLOT_COUNT-3, the bean will initially go right
 * SLOT_COUNT-3 times, and then left 2 times, falling into slot SLOT_COUNT-3.
